1. Responsible AI
	- Fairness - ai system should treat all people the same, not beinn biased on gender, race etc.
	- Relability and Savety - vehicles etc has to be safe, regular testing
	- Privacy and security - models and data used to train them, np. our data in storage account shouldn't be used to train other shit
	- Inclusiveness - every part of society sholud be able to take advantage of this
	- Transparency - we shold now as much as possible how it work
	- Accountability - there should be framework that solution meets ethical, legal standards

2. What is AI
	Software that exhibits human-like abilities
	- Visual perception - understanding video, text etc.
	- Language - idea to use natural language processing, understanding semantic meaning
	- Speech - text to speech - speech to text, conversational AI
	- Decision making - treshold that triggers decision in my mind
	
	AI builds on top of machine learning.
	Machine learning - all data + algorithms used to train prediction models
	Machine learning is build on top of data science which is math and statistics used to analyse data.

3. Azure ML

	I have data that I have labeled. Data to traning and data to test. 
	Data -> train -> (create) model -> deploy model -> Data (feedback)

4. Azure Cognitive Services (Azure AI)

	Visual Perception:
		Image analysis (picture give me info about it).
		Video analysis (info about/from video)
		Image clasification
		Object detection (where is specifc object in image)
		Facial analysis
		OCR (optical character recognition)

	Language:
		Language understanding 
			Question-answering
			Text analysis
		Translation

	Speech:
		Speech to text
		Text to speech
		Speech translation
		Speaker recognition

	Decision making:
		Anomaly detection (f.e. temperature rising)
		Content moderation
		Content personalization (shopping cart)

	Prebuild solutions:
	- Forms recognizer
	- Metrics adviser
	- Video analyser for media
	- Image reader
	- BOT service (some kind of conversational interaction) - webchat, email interactions, teams and shit
	- Cognitive search 
		you have data your going to ingest to create an index and run diffrent types of search against this index to give result
		you can enrich the index

5. Deploying to Azure

	Azure Cognitive Services
	Provisioning service to subscription + region which give RESOURCE (Cognitive service resource)
	When provisioning use name (np. eastus)

	Resource can be:
		- multi-service
			it is a single restfull endpoint witch single access credential
		- single-service
		note: training might require diffrent resource

		- resource ma endpoint uri
		- Cognitive Services Account ma 2 klucze (account keY), mozna przegenerowywac 1 podczas uzycia 2giego itp.
		Klucze powinny byc persystowane w key vaulcie.
		Resourcy maja swoj firewall wiec mozna restrict access do nich (do np. konkretnych public IPs)
		Service endpoints i private endpoints

6. REST API and SDK

	Need to know:
	endpoint URI and Keys (best to read from keyVault)

	We are creating JSON paylod in http to the endpoint and it responds with another json data.

7. Pricing and monitoring

	Paid based on number of interactions.
	There is azure pricing calculator

	- metrics, alerts, logs, same as in S4D + integration with event hub

8. Deploying to container

	We can run model locally (on-premise) in container for example for safety requirements (car, fabryka roboty itp.)

	Microsoft Artifacts Registry - to persist this containers

	Owe docker image robimy based of 'from image' (based on Azure Cognitive Services image), do ktorych uruchomienia potrzebujemy:
	Billing.ApiKey,	BILLING.Endpoint URI, EULA (eula='accept') (End-User License Agreement)
	wymagane jest jakies połaczenie internetowe do raportowania tych rzeczy i zgody na EULA, 
	pobrania api keya, zeby autoryzowac sie poslugiwania servicami uruchomionymi lokalnie

9. Visual Perception Services

	Image analysis:
		Sending picture of car -> returns some info about it (f.e. image description)
		Można ten image skategoryzować, nadać mu tag (car, sun).
		Może też miec object Car: {X, Y, Height, Top}
		Mozna robic content moderation (filtrowac zdejcia przemoca), ratingowac zdjecia, robic celebrity recognition
		Mozna robic miniaturki

	Video analysis:
		Facial recognition (detecting presence of indiviudal people in image)
		OCR
		Speech transcription
		Key topics in the video
		it can have idea of: Sentiment (positive video, negative video)
		it can have idea of: Label - key themes, objects in the video
		content moderation, scene segmentation

		jesli chcemty rozpoznwaca ludzi, powinnismy miec Limited Access Approval

	Image Clasification:
		predict class label based on main subject of an image (vehicle, fruit, vegetable)
		We have to train it.
		Start with data (image) and label it -> train -> model 
		Send other images to model and in will predict its a car with some specs. It is multilabel

	Object detection
		Znajdowanie obiektow na image

	Facial Analysis
		Face service, ensure privacy of that information
		It will not say gender and not say age (it might be offensive for people - lol).
		Sa w 2 servicy, ktore moga pomoc z detekcja twarzy. General computer vision service (hey, yes there is a face i jest tutaj)
		i Face Service - go further - (yes there is a face and has some attributes, rozpoznaje nos, oczy, itp.)
		Face service (where it is, info about it, detection and verification)
		- Every face detection will have unique id and will be cached for 24h. (came in to building, left building)
		- Face recognition, sklada sie to z Person Group i image, ktore pozwalaja wytrenowac ta usluge do rozpoznawania konkretnych ludzi,
		that will be persisted

	OCR
		Znow sa 2 API do tego:
		Read API - (read from images, read from pdf, small to large volume (book/magazines)) -  main service to use, handle large volume shit
		Image Analysis API - (supported formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, PDF, TIFF up to 2000 pages, less 500 MB)
			obsluguje 164 print languages, 9 languages for handwritten text

10. Language Understanding

	Idea of learned
		CLU (Custom language understading) - we have to train it on some INTENT (get time) which has possible 
			Utterences and related Entity (what time is it, tell me the time, what is the time in (entity): London
			Train -> test -> deploy -> review -> feedback Train
		Custom named entities (person, event, skill, value) - pass array of labels and give it entities in represent (training) - pass data as JSON
		Custom text classification (document text and classify to custom groups) 
			Single label - bunch of possible lables (L1, L2, L3, L4) and bunch of texts. Text has only 1 label
			Multi label - Text has multiple labels

	Idea of pre-configured
		Summarization (bunch of text -> key senteces about it)
		PII Detection (IP addresses, email, street addresses, health info, name detection itp.)

		About the learned - 2 important parameters:
		Recalll - of the actuall labels how many was identified? ratio true positives to all labeled.
			Imagine I search for "pizza" -> returned 4 docs, 3 correct, 1 was shit, there were 3 more good -> Recall = 3/6
		Precision - 3/4 (4 docs returned, 3 correct)

11. Questions answering and Text analysis

	a) Question answering

	About the pre-configured:
	
	We are going to create Knowledge Base based on files, online, chit-chat files, dbs. Then we can use from chat assistant
	It is implemented as:
	BOT -> Q to knowledge base -> Answer returned as JSON
		We can have `top` parameter for top 3 best answers.

	b) Text analysis

		Extract info from text. Features:

		- langugae detection
		- key phrase extraction
		- sentiment analysis
		- named entity recognition
		- entity linking

12. Translation

	Language detection
	One-to-many translation
	Transliteration - converting text from native script to alternative script (from 1 alphabet to diffrent alphabet)

13. Speech Services
